Compilation Steps :
------------------

* Clone the repository from https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/CENTENNIAL.git

git clone https://github.com/OpenNetworkingFoundation/CENTENNIAL.git

* Setup Opendaylight profiles in the mvn settings as explained in the link below 

https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/GettingStarted:Development_Environment_Setup

* Go to folder CENTENNIAL/02-MWTN-PoC/code/odl

* Compile the source code 

mvn clean install -DskipTests=true

(Note 1: mvn will download all the required dependency jar files from Opendaylight nexus repository. So internet connectivity is mandatory)
(Note 2: If you are behind proxy, mvn settings - ~/.m2/settings.xml - should be updated with proxy details ) 

* Opendaylight distribution will be created in karaf folder 


Running Opendaylight: 
---------------------

* Go to folder karaf/target/assembly/bin

* Start Karaf 

./karaf clean 

* All the required features will be installed automatically 

* Wait for karaf to install features (about 30 seconds) . Monitor the log by typing log:tail and verify odl-mwt-models is installed 

Wait for a message as shown below , which indicates netconfconnector feature is started and ready for connection from mediator
